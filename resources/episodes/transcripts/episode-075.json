Is the pub cap open?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (00:15)\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\nAll right, you ready?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (00:22)\r\nDude, I'm freaking born ready. I'm caffeinated. I'm ready to roll.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (00:25)\r\nOkay, I was on Twitter last week and I saw a viral tweet. 2.2 million views by Felix.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mind just went like... So this is what the tweet says, remote jobs for introverts, no talking required. You can do them in the evening from home after your nine to five job and they pay well in USD. Open this arrow pointing down 2.2 million views. And all he does is go on to like list like a Tesla job or an Apple job that like would be good for an introvert. So we've never really talked about the job board business before, but other podcasts have.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (00:36)\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (01:03)\r\nIt's an amazing business because it's very, very passive, right? You just, okay, let me stop. Let me stop. Let me start why it's a bad business. It's a bad business because it's a marketplace. You need buyers and you need sellers. You need people to list jobs and you need people to find jobs. Marketplaces are hard, but if you can figure out the marketplace, if you can go niche and do something a little different than a job board is an amazing business because it is so passive. You don't have customer support, companies go find it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey list a job for two to $500 and then people go find the jobs and apply the jobs. So what about a job board for introverts or extroverts? Go.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (01:41)\r\ninteresting. So it's not a job board based on job type. It's a job board based on like personality type.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (01:47)\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (01:49)\r\nI think that's really creative. Like there is, there is a big trend right now happening. And you see it with like decoupling, right? We used to have big cable companies, Comcast, and then what did we do? Now all of a sudden we've got Netflix and Hulu and ESPN plus and CB whatever. Like now we're like buying all of those things individually. You see it large social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. Well,\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, like local communities are becoming more and more popular. And the same thing is happening with hiring, right? And job boards. Like there's a thing as a physician job board that's pretty small, but it's doing like $80 million a year because it's just targeted at physicians or where there's nursing job boards or and it's not necessarily as high tech as some of these other job boards, but it's a it's very niche. And so, hey, I know exactly what I'm going for and I know that it's going to serve me and my community.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut those are all job type specific, which I still love them. Like you and I have talked about doing a job board, but I've never thought about doing it based on like personality type. How would you build it?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (02:56)\r\nYeah, why not? Well, you're go find all the subreddits and all the the Facebook groups for introverts. I mean, it is a religion. Like, in my household, we talk about introverts and extroverts on a weekly basis. It's split down the Yeah, it's just like a thing. I don't know how it started. But all my kids refer to it. There's three introverts and three extroverts in my family. And as our friend Steven would say labels disable, he would not like that. But forget it labels are awesome. So\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (03:04)\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, labels are for disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (03:27)\r\nI like this also because you don't need to have any coding experience. JBoard.io and Niceboard.co. Those are both awesome, like out of the box, plug and play job board pieces of software. So I think if you can find the community, have them rally around your cause, then you can go aggregate a bunch of jobs that are already listed on other websites that might be befitting of an introvert and list them yourself so you're not\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (03:36)\r\nIt's a nice board.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (03:56)\r\nan empty marketplace. That way you can have the supply side full before you get the demand side. And then once you get some traction from the job applicants, then you can actually go out and start soliciting people to put paid listings up.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (04:09)\r\nTalk to me about the technology for it. Cause that kind of just, it's always scared me. it's a job board. Someone's got to go online. They got to apply. I wouldn't know how to build the platform necessary to handle the inbound, the screening, the communications, et cetera. Think of like Upwork, right? You post to Upwork, you don't want them going around or Upwork at least, or Fiverr. They don't want them going around and billing you. They want the transaction to go through their platform because that's how they get paid. They charge a percentage of the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (04:32)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (04:39)\r\nSo in my mind, it's technologically complicated. Is it not? Like, would it not be hard to build a platform for a job board like this?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (04:48)\r\nThat is literally what I just said was there's two out. It's plug in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (04:49)\r\nI know I heard don't be don't don't do that. I freaking hate when you do that. I just thought it's easy. What I'm saying what I'm saying is those two things solve that like you would be able to have a job board platform that allows for private communications payment processing. Okay, all that stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (05:02)\r\nYeah. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nit does all that.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (05:08)\r\nHow would you charge for it? Would it be the same as every other model? just a percentage of placement? is it like recurrent, like up working?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (05:16)\r\nIt's a flat fee per post to pay to the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (05:20)\r\nMmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaid by the employer, you mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, so people who are joining it aren't paying. It's on a.\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be the way to work up to it? I feel like you'd have to work up to the marketplace because you have to have, like you said, it's double-sided. You have to have the supply and the demand. It's just really hard to bring them both together at the same time. It seems like you want to start locally, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (05:48)\r\nWell, you go to other job boards and you take their listings that seem to be like a listing for an introvert and you just put it on your website.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (05:57)\r\nSo just your gut like, I think this looks like an introvert. You wouldn't necessarily beforehand kind of write a script and say, these are the job functions and titles that I want and then just go run it. I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (06:10)\r\nMost of these job board platforms have, like API integrations with the indeed of the world. So you can, you can, with one click, you can fill the job board with jobs. and like they're not paying you, but who cares? You're just trying to make it look like an active marketplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (06:21)\r\nHmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nso the supply is done. Supply is taken care of. You don't have to convince anybody to go do it. It'd be the demand side. And that's where you're saying Reddit, going onto the Reddit subreddits.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (06:36)\r\nYeah, that's to find the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (06:41)\r\nDude, I like it. What else could you do? Okay, introverts and extroverts. I wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (06:48)\r\nYou can do it with like, you know, Myers-Briggs type stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (06:52)\r\nYou know what would an interesting one is ex professional athletes. I know that's like hyper niche, but. I love hiring ex collegiate annex. I haven't hired that many professional athletes, but like ex collegiate athletes like they work hard. They know what it takes. They usually are disciplined. They're driven. I like if you could go to a an employer and or like market it as like hey, this is the profile and we only market these two.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (07:11)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (07:21)\r\nprofessional athletes, let's say. I think you get a lot of people signing up and probably even charge a premium because it is so much more targeted.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (07:27)\r\nYeah. Yeah. I mean, you could do, I mean, you could get a lot more niche than that. If you wanted, you could do like D two athletes. You could do like D two track and field athletes. you could do return missionaries, like LDS return missionaries. yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (07:36)\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nDude, I like that idea. All right, I'm starting one. I'm starting one, you ready? So I know you know the answer to these questions, all right? I know you know, but I'm ask you anyway, because I'm trying to set it up for the listener, Chris, okay? Don't, hey, hey, hey, hey, my eyes, they're up here, okay buddy? I'm just kidding.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (07:47)\r\na good one. Okay, do it. Yep.\r\n\r\n\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, I'm getting, I'm eating gum, okay? Can I pull some gum out?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (08:10)\r\nYou know what spirit Halloween is. And anybody who's listening probably knows what spirit Halloween and if you don't know what spirit Halloween is, think of the Halloween store that pops up every year around this time of year in the vacant closed down, you know, sports chalet, sports authority, whatever you whatever Sears, whatever company that went out of business and they just haven't filled the rent spirit pops up and they sell Halloween costumes and Halloween accessories.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (08:12)\r\nAhem.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (08:39)\r\nI want you to first take a guess for me. For companies that are in the space of Halloween costumes, decorations, the Halloween industry, whatever you want to call it, how much do you think they generate every year in revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\nRight costumes, decorations, accessories, toys, all that stuff. How much do think they generate?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (09:04)\r\n200 million.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (09:06)\r\nOkay. Thank you. You just softballed me, dude. 12, $12 billion a year. 12 billion with a B. Okay. Now the next question, Spirit Halloween. All right. That little company, it's literally a pop-up company. They operate for a short period of time. How much do think that they generate every single year in revenue?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (09:10)\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf a billion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (09:35)\r\nOK, 1.2 billion. They're about 10 % of the total market. 1.2 it's a billion dollar company that just does pop up Halloween sales, so. my I got my my gears going to and got Papa Nick thinking about this and I wanted to bring this up to Chris. The observer correct or at Christopher James Kerner. wanted to talk about. In my mind, there are seasonal opportunities for businesses that you don't think about until it's happening. That.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (10:03)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (10:05)\r\nare interesting and so I'm going to I'm going to name a couple Christmas tree farms and Christmas tree lots. I think those are fascinating. We've we've talked about this before fireworks. Fourth of July. And New Year's the problem is because they are seasonal, you aren't necessarily thinking about all year. It takes a long time to get them spun up. There is a potential investment. So my question to you distribution guru.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (10:15)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (10:35)\r\nChristopher James Kerner, how would you think about spinning up a seasonal business? Like how would you go about, all right, I wanna do Christmas lights. What would be like your next step?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (10:49)\r\nOne word. You ready?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (10:53)\r\nYeah?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (10:55)\r\nPiggyback.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'ma see myself out. I'm done. We're done here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (11:01)\r\nI want my piggyback piggyback piggyback piggyback. What do mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (11:05)\r\nPiggyback, you gotta go find the service brands that are not too small, but not too big and borrow their customers. Say, hey, you own a landscaping business. I know you've got a crew, you've got six trucks. Do you do Christmas lights? No, we think about, okay, I do. Can you just like refer us for, you know, we'll give you a cut or would you just like white label us? You can charge, you can collect the payment and just pay us 70 % of it and we'll come do the actual work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (11:23)\r\nMmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (11:34)\r\nJust tap in.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (11:36)\r\nso you're just like, all right, who already has access to the target market that I want access to? And I'm to go to them. So that makes sense. Landscaping companies. What about, okay, Christmas tree farms?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat would be an interesting one.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (11:55)\r\nLike how would I launch a Christmas tree farm you're asking?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (11:58)\r\nNo, just how would you how would you go about identifying who like who would have access to your target demographic? I always see them in like a grocery store parking lot or like a Home Depot or. And maybe maybe that's a market where it's like they've kind of already got their people right like my town Tuscaloosa, Alabama already has the tree lots that everybody goes to and maybe that's maybe that's a bad one. But here's a let's let's do another example seasonal.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (12:09)\r\nMmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I got an idea. So we're assuming that we're launching a Christmas tree farm, right? Is that what you're saying? Okay, so\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (12:30)\r\nOkay, I'm\r\n\r\n\r\nYes. Or Christmas tree lot that sells the trees, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (12:40)\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And we're also assuming that we're not going to be, you know, raising these trees ourselves. We're going to go buy them from someone else. Okay, so with that in mind, I don't think there's any loyalty to the Christmas tree business. I think it's one of those things where, you know, every November rolls around, families driving around, they see it in the corner parking lot out in front of the Home Depot or whatever it is like, it's time to get a Christmas tree. They don't know what company's behind it. They don't care.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (12:45)\r\nRight, exactly. Yep.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (13:05)\r\nThey just, want a real Christmas tree. So they always buy it from the place that they see it. And maybe it's at this intersection one year and that intersection another year. They don't know or care if it's the same business or not. So what I would do is I would not worry about any competitors. I would go to the department of transportation website and look at the traffic counts at all the intersections in my local area, however far away I'm willing to drive. And I would find the one with the most cars. And then I would whittle it down, look at Google Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (13:31)\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (13:33)\r\nand find the intersections that actually have space for something like this because many of them won't. And then I would go to the tax records and find the owner of that land and try to lease that land for two months every year. And then I would just pop up shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (13:49)\r\nAll right. I got that's a genius idea. I'm going to try to level it up a little bit. How could you? So you are talking about getting customers by the busiest streets. All right. Because that's that's certainly how they're done. Right. Hey, I'm going to see it and then I'm to pull over and I'm going to go and buy a tree. How could you find them before the impulse buy? Like, could you target on Facebook like, hey, reserve your Christmas tree today, 20 percent off and like\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (14:05)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (14:18)\r\npre-sell these Christmas trees and then go to a commercial? I'm sure you could find a commercial tree farm because surely the tree farms are not the ones who are also popping up in the Ralph's or Kroger's parking lot, right? I'm sure you could find a commercial tree farm and negotiate a lower rate and you're essentially just wholesaling them. then obviously you would have to solve for the delivery. But is there a way you could go upstream and digitally market to those people, either through Facebook or through Google or Instagram and get them to buy?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (14:30)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (14:48)\r\neven before they're on the road with the impulse buy for trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (14:52)\r\nthink you could. I think that makes logical sense, but I've never seen anyone doing it. So it would just make me nervous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (14:57)\r\nso no one's ever done it before.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (15:00)\r\nI mean, really, like, I just don't want to be the first person to try that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would go to the guy who is doing it and just kind of like talk them up a little bit. it's a cool business. how many of these trees you go through every season? And I'm sure they get asked that all the time. It's like, okay, 2000 trees every season in two months. This intersection has 20,000 cars. So I can expect to do 10 % of the amount of cars in trees. This intersection has 75,000 cars. I wonder if I could do 7,500 trees in two months. Huh? Like,\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (15:08)\r\nYeah, that's a say.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (15:37)\r\nI need to pull out all the stops to get one of those four corners of that intersection. And then I would just try to open hopefully a little earlier than the other guy. It's not really necessary. It's just a location game, I think.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (15:49)\r\nYeah. Well, like Christmas trees are just one, but there are a ton of just seasonal businesses, snow cone stands, ice cream stands, car washes in the summer, like fundraising things. I saw one that was an ice rink. posted about it. Like someone just like made an ice rink in their backyard that I thought was super cool. But I think there are the seasonal businesses that by the time you see them and you're like, dude, I want to launch that business. It's just too late. So\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (16:05)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (16:19)\r\nI like the idea of like working my way back and thinking, all right, next year, if I was going to do a Christmas lights business, what am I going to do? And I like, I really like that idea of just go and find the landscape or like go and find who already has that target demographic and then reverse engineer it with them. Like piggyback, gosh, dang it, Chris, you're good at this. You're good at this.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (16:34)\r\nYep. I don't know. I'm the framework guy. What do want me to say? Tattoo it on my forehead, Nick.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (16:43)\r\nAll right, what you got?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (16:45)\r\nAlright, I got a funny one. It's kind of funny. A little comedic break for you. But this could be a thing. Okay?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (16:51)\r\nOkay. You had me at funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (16:55)\r\nI know you don't watch the show. Love is blind. Do you get the concept? Okay, well for those\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (16:59)\r\nYes. It's blind people dating and they take their sticks and they like feel the other person's face. They're like, I think they're good looking, right? That's how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (17:08)\r\nThat's Bum Fights. No, that's, that got canceled. No, for those who don't know Love is Blind is like one of the biggest shows on Netflix and there's like seven seasons now. They're releasing three seasons a year, which tells me it's very, very popular. Of course it's Netflix. They don't have to disclose how many viewers they're getting, but clearly it's very popular.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole concept is you have men in pods, about 15 men and women in pods and they don't have their phones. They don't bring in their phones with them. They just have each other and then they date like through a wall. So you can hear each other's voice. You can talk, but they're not allowed to talk about each other's appearance and they're not allowed to see each other until after they have proposed until they're engaged. Okay. So go ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (17:51)\r\nOkay, it's like online dating, but you're actually hearing them. Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (17:55)\r\nNo pictures. Yep. You hear you hear their real voice, but you are not allowed to talk about your appearance and you're not allowed to see each other and you don't have your phone. So you literally it's it is it is a pure show in the sense in the sense that they can't see each other. And in every other sense, it is a very impure show. Okay. so it's very entertaining and the best part, there's two best parts of the season. Number one is when they first see each other, right? The sliding doors open and they're like,\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (18:07)\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (18:25)\r\nAnd it's just like, you can just read on their faces. Do they like what they see or not?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (18:29)\r\nBecause there's two emotions that are potentially at play. There's excitement as the viewer. You're like excited for them to see. And then immediately there could be the cringe of like, she doesn't like him. you know what I mean?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (18:37)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nhuh.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. Yeah, well, it's just you watch their faces and when they first see each other and sometimes they're like, and you can like just for a split second in their eyes, you can be like, no, no, no. It's like that Leo DiCaprio meme where it's like, and he's pointing. It's like, you think he's ugly. You think she's ugly. And so it's just so good because then they embrace and they hug and they kiss and they share rings and you can just tell if one of them is not into it. Sometimes neither one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (18:48)\r\nRight, right.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (19:13)\r\nis into it. And I just love it because all of them in the pods are like, honestly, I don't even care about looks. Honestly, like, like for real though, I don't care about looks. I don't even care. You could be 500 pounds. I just don't care. They all say that to each other. And it's like, dude, stop, stop. Just stop. Okay. Anyway, I haven't even gotten to the idea yet. That's the concept. So that's the best part of the season. And then the other best part of the season is when they go to the altar, because a lot of times at the altar, even most of the time,\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of them says, nevermind, I'm out. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (19:43)\r\nthey're getting married? Holy, OK. wow. That's high stakes,\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (19:49)\r\nThey get engaged before they see each other and then they go on vacation together, like all the couples to like a resort in Mexico and they like date, date, and then they go back home to like live in the real world together and then they have a wedding day and they're not allowed to like break up before the altar. They have to break up at the altar if they're going to break up. They're like contractually obligated. So, okay, here's the idea. Are you ready for this?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (19:55)\r\nUh-huh.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy-\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (20:16)\r\nThis could be done on a small scale. It doesn't have to be a Netflix show. It could be done with iPhones, okay? You're gonna love this. You ready for it?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (20:25)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (20:27)\r\nIt's love is blind except one of the genders. It could be male, could be female, doesn't matter, are little people. And the other gender are normally sized people and they are not allowed, the little people are not allowed to disclose it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (20:45)\r\nDo they know before they go, do they know before going into it that it's it?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (20:45)\r\nAnd then there's a reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNope. The little people, the little people assume that it's a show like love is blind only for little people. And the other people assume that it's just, it's kind of like a love is blind copycat. And then you have the big reveal and we will truly know if love is blind when that reveal happens. Tell me that wouldn't be good television.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (20:53)\r\nChris, you're wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf it'd be good television. I don't know that you could do it for more than one season though.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (21:15)\r\nCould you imagine?\r\n\r\n\r\nyou could. You totally could.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (21:21)\r\nCan I? Okay. Man, this is is taking a left turn. Do you remember when we were growing up? I mean, even now they have movies and like in the movies is like the ugly girl or the ugly guy or the guy that's gross or like whatever. I think about those people probably because I identify with them. But like that would suck to be like, yeah, I'm a movie star. I'm a movie star. I'm in all, you know, like Steve Buscemi. I'm like, I'm a movie star. And it's like ugly man enters the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (21:43)\r\nYou're reading the script? Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nFat Amy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (21:51)\r\nYeah, it's like you just always known as that. At least at least when you're famous, you have a lot of money to kind of like console yourself. Do you think there could be some like emotional damage? Emotional damage for either one of them, like the little people when they're like, wait, they didn't like me or for the regular size person when they just feel bait and switched.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know. That feels to me like you're upping the stakes and upping the likelihood of there being even just some mental trauma there.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (22:29)\r\nYeah. Is that going to happen? Absolutely. Is it going to be me that does it? No, someone much less ethical than me will launch this business. I would never do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (22:38)\r\nI thought you're gonna say like business is blind.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (22:41)\r\nNo, it's going to be called love is, it's going to be called love is little.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (22:46)\r\nWhat about little lovers?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (22:47)\r\nThat's something else entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (22:50)\r\nWhat about a little bit of love?\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the weirdest. I love that you brought it up, but that is one of the weirdest, the weirdest ideas. All right, I got one for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (23:01)\r\nHey, would it not be good entertainment?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (23:04)\r\nit'd be good entertainment. would just be hard to pull off. You'd have to actually have the know-how and the infrastructure. right. You ready? Two weeks ago, beautiful Saturday, 80 degrees here in Boise, Idaho. And what did my family decide to do? We decided to get dressed up as if it's the fall and go take family pictures. Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (23:28)\r\nSame, we did it too.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (23:30)\r\nFamily pictures are awful. least when your kids, at least when your kids are, yes, when your kids are little in particular and they're not listening and they're fighting with each other. And then it's like, we've got to retake that because so-and-so didn't smile or so-and-so messed up. I freaking hate it. I just, I hate it. It was much better this year than it was the year before because Ellis, dude, don't give me Taco Bell an hour before I'm supposed to take family pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (23:32)\r\nthe worst hour of my year.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick pooped his pants again. We gotta retake that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are you gonna do? That's what I'm tacoing about.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (23:55)\r\nAnyways, I made a run for the border. I'll tell you what anyways, so we're in the we're in the middle of this field. We're taking pictures and it just hits me. Why and maybe this exists, but so I'm bringing this up. I would pay money more money to a photographer if they were like, hey, look. Don't even worry about everybody getting on the same page and a few pictures. I'm going to take enough pictures of your family and I'm now using AI where.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll be able to get everybody smiling and looking. And if there's a specific thing that you want, like I'll be able to to render it or model it. I don't even know what the right terminology is, but sure, there is editing technology that's existed for a long time that could like put a smile on someone's face or take a blemish away or make your eyes a different color. But the ability now of AI to generate images of people. Is almost indistinguishable like.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (24:42)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (24:52)\r\nNow I can tell that there's a difference, but when you first saw it, you didn't really know. But now you're like, the skin's too smooth or the hands messed up or like whatever. So my idea would be. Somebody who's AI savvy would go figure out the optical software necessary and just reach out to videographers, photographers, family photographers this time of year in particular and sell them a package that makes their job way easier. It's just like instantly creates the perfect family portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\nand I think that they would crush. What do think?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (25:25)\r\nThis is an amazing idea and I love it. And I love you for saying it. And I'm going to edit this idea to where it comes from my mouth when this becomes published.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (25:29)\r\nYes!\r\n\r\n\r\nHehehehehe\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't care.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (25:41)\r\nAlright, let me do you one further, okay? You ready?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (25:43)\r\nOkay, yep.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (25:48)\r\njust share your Apple photos album with me or your Google photos album with me done or you know, Hey mom, curate some of your favorite pictures of your kids. Maybe they're running around the house in a diaper. Maybe it's like a school picture. I don't care. Just share them with me. I'll do all the rest. And then you just, Hey, here's the family at the hayride. Here's the family in a Halloween setting at a Christmas setting at everything, anything you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the family on Mount Everest, whatever you want. It could be goofy, it could be real, it could be a Western saloon style, and it could cost next to nothing. And I love your idea of piggybacking on the photographers because that makes distribution easier, but you don't even have to. This is just a website. This could just be a website. 50 bucks, 49 bucks, 19 bucks, where you just link your Google Photos album or your Apple Photos, and you just make it happen, and it just auto-generates.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (26:26)\r\neasier.\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm gonna take your level, level it up one. Have you ever done one of these? Have you ever like gone to AI generating websites and they're like, upload 10 pictures of yourself? I have. And I used my Apple, Google Photos and the AI Nick was not good. It did not look like me. But it was because the pictures that I had just weren't either consistent or like not a good angle or the resolution wasn't great, et cetera. What if we brought back the mall?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (26:46)\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (27:08)\r\nnot photo booths, like photo shops where you go and as a family and take photos. And it's like instead of family pictures and dressing up to go in the middle of the sun on, you know, in a field or whatever, you just go to the studio. You take X number of pictures per kid. And then those are the photos that they use for that year's. Christmas card, right? Like and then you don't have to worry about like, I want it during the golden hour, so I'm going make sure to get there between four and five and we can't be too early. We can't be too late, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (27:27)\r\nMmm. Mm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we had to do, yep.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (27:37)\r\nSo you go, it's studio, lighting's really good. You get really good pictures. And then, like you said, you use AI to edit it and you spit out the family Christmas card.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (27:49)\r\nthink could do that. But I don't think you have to do all that. I think you could just say like, Hey, mom, just take your iPhone and get a few pictures of your kids smiling and I'll take care of the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (27:52)\r\nReally?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe it's maybe it's gotten better now. I'm just saying that when I took my pictures and I took 10 of them and I uploaded it and it was like going to generate me the Nick AI, it was not. It was not good.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (28:10)\r\nI think, I think mid journey and comfy UI has better options now. Cause I did a headshot generator as well for Jesse and it was. Okay. It was passable, but it wouldn't be used for this. Like you're saying. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (28:15)\r\nreally?\r\n\r\n\r\nJesse's looked good.\r\n\r\n\r\nJesse's was fine, and that was like a year ago, wasn't it?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (28:26)\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (28:28)\r\nYeah, so maybe you're right. Well, either way, that's for someone to solve, right? Like either you could do it and it's like, you got to have an iPhone 14 or higher because you need this much resolution and you need to have these lights set up or whatever, right? Like these are the parameters or you can for an upcharge, you can come in and we'll do it all for you. But I family pictures in particular, I just I freaking love the idea of never ever in my life having to go do family pictures again with my family.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (28:32)\r\nYou\r\n\r\n\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah. And I will say my kids are older than yours, eight, 10, 12, 14, and we just got ours done two weeks ago and it was still terrible. Terrible because my kids were terrible. No, no, actually they were the most well behaved they've ever been, but I was terrible because I was hungry and it was taking forever. It was taking so long and there was always another shot that she had to get. And I hope she's not listening right now because I hated it. So this is just another unbundling idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (29:04)\r\nThank you. Great.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (29:26)\r\nRight? There's a zillion AI headshot generators out there. We're just saying, Hey, AI generated photos for family pictures. Right? That's it. That's it. This needs to be a thing. I love it. It's beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (29:34)\r\nYes. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, dude. And think about move. Think about this. If I told your wife or if you told my wife, hey, hey, you want to do family pictures once a year or would you like to send out a card in the fall? And around Christmas. And in the spring and what about a back to school card? what about the summer recap card or what? You know or it's Royce's birthday. What about that card like all of a sudden you don't need to be like once a year. Get everybody together and have.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (29:57)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (30:07)\r\nfamily picture, you can generate them like throughout the year without all the freaking hassle.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (30:13)\r\nDude, you know what this is this you've heard of chat books, right? Shout out to to homeboy Nate Quigley, my friend from live TV slash I say friend I really mean boss he was my boss he he founded chat books in Utah. Big company, it could be a chat books. It could be like the AI chat books, right? Or it's like a subscription because chat all chat books does is it syncs with your your Google Photos and your Instagram and every month or every quarter it will just send you a physical book of your pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (30:17)\r\nOf yeah, I've had this for years.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (30:43)\r\nIt could be like that, but for AI pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (30:45)\r\nI guess what Jess does is like, she'll go and select the ones that she wants. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (30:50)\r\nYeah, you can do that too. You can do that too. But this would have been great for you know, my family because my parents got divorced when I was 13. And we never went on vacations after the divorce. So we could have generated pictures of us on the beach and on vacation and we could have been an AI generated happy family. It would have been nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (31:08)\r\nAI is going to make a lot of families happy, actually, when you think about it. Not yours, but families in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (31:11)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (31:20)\r\nAll right, what do you got?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (31:22)\r\nAll right, let's see.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (31:26)\r\nI'm so happy you liked that one.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (31:29)\r\nSo am I. Because they're not all winners.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (31:30)\r\nyou\r\n\r\n\r\nHahaha!\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (31:36)\r\nWoo. What if like these episodes are actually two hours long and we just edit out so much of them, they land at like 40 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlright, I got one for you. So Zapier and make. Okay, ZAPE. That's what I'm about to do. Would you stop being so aggressive on my show?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (31:53)\r\nWill you explain the two of them? sorry. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (32:01)\r\nZapier connects APIs from all kinds of tools and platforms. It's very cheap. On the surface, it's very cheap. does the exact make.com, formerly known as Integromot. Maybe the most obvious branding change ever. Make is like 85 % cheaper than Zapier, but does the same thing, but is significantly more difficult to use. You don't need to be a programmer. It's just clunky. The UI isn't great.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (32:23)\r\nMm hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (32:29)\r\nClearly a big company because they have a four letter domain name but they do the same thing. Make and Zapier are the same company. Zapier is just five to six times more expensive. So use something like builtwith which is a website where you can know what any website in the world is built with and you can scrape a list of every single Zapier customer on the internet or you can you know you can do cold outreach to them in many other different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you reach out to them with this offer. Hey, why are you using Zapier? You're spending way too much money on your automations. I will convert you to make and charge 30 % of the savings because like our Zapier bill is 300 bucks a month. know people that pay 3000 to $10,000 a month to Zapier when their make.com bill would literally be a 10th of that and accomplish the same thing. So you're basically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a, this is your foot in the door. You get your foot in the door by converting them from Zapier to make you're basically stealing customers from Zapier. And then the real money is in being like their automation go to guy for a monthly flat fee. You fix everything that breaks. You add more automations, you fix the old automations. it's just your way to get your foot in the door. You could even do it for free just to get your foot in the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (33:49)\r\nWe've talked about the automations and AI companies before, but this is just like, you're not even targeting companies who may or may not have it. You're targeting companies who you know have it. Can we debate really quickly? Why do you still call it Zapier? Why do you not call it Zapier?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (34:00)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause I've been using it for 11 years and it's what I've always called it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (34:11)\r\nSo isn't it so funny, like, how you like find these words. And then the first time you hear it after years of saying it the wrong way, you're like, that's wrong. I don't care that they founded the company. They're saying it wrong. I agree with you. It's Zephyr. Anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (34:22)\r\nYeah. I know like as soon as right after my parents got divorced, Ron moved in and I just kept calling him dad because it was like, that's my dad figure, you know, so silly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's up? Is that too dark?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (34:38)\r\nIt was too close to home actually. anyways, I'm not gonna keep going. Okay, a couple questions, because I'm like an idiot with this. When you say that built with will tell you who the Zapier customers are.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (34:41)\r\nyeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (34:56)\r\nHow does does bit with work? It doesn't just tell you who built the website. It also tells you what API integrations the website is implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (35:04)\r\nfor certain API integrations. Yeah, not for everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (35:07)\r\nOkay, so it only catch certain ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (35:10)\r\nYeah, like for instance, your website might have a Stripe integration, like a Stripe connection or Stripe widget or like a Facebook pixel integration connection or widget, but it's not built on a Facebook pixel. It's not built on Stripe, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (35:19)\r\nHmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd are you just assuming that it's Zapier? Like if someone has a Stripe payment automation, is there any other way that it could be something else? Or is it going to be through Zapier?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (35:36)\r\nIt's like, I mean, Zapier has like 80 % of the market, so.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (35:40)\r\nOkay, so you're making, but you are making some assumption. It's not saying like, Zapier is, okay, cool. How does, I don't know this, how does Zapier charge? Is it a volume thing or is it like the number of API calls or is it the number of unique APIs that you have on your website? Does that make sense what I'm asking?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (35:42)\r\nhuh. Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, they charge by number of zaps, which is like an integration, right? So if I want to add subscribers to be hive from Google Sheets, that's one zap. And then it will charge by tasks, which is the number of times it moves an email from Google Sheets to be hive on like a credit system. So I could have one zap that has like multiple steps that could cost like three or four credits. It's not necessarily one, one credit for every task.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (36:16)\r\nGot it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGot it.\r\n\r\n\r\nfor this purpose, if I'm just trying to identify the zaps that a website has, it's not also going to tell me the volume that are being transacted across that. No. Okay. Could you\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (36:36)\r\nNo. No. Hey, real quick, I got to close the door. My kids just got from school.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (36:42)\r\nYeah. gosh, get her.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuiet down. everybody, Carson, quiet down. Yeah, it'll make me money one day.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (36:56)\r\nYou heard I said.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll right, keep going.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (37:02)\r\nNo, we can't eat dinner tonight. We don't have what I was getting at is like, could is there any way that you could identify who the mega users were? Right? So instead of just a blanket or blast, you could maybe tailor your approach to say like, I know this company's using Zapier, and they're probably paying five grand a month just based on the number of integrations they have, like, is there a way you could sort of get a proxy for how much they're spending? Or is it just\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (37:19)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (37:29)\r\nYou can't really do that. could have one zap, but it's running, you know, thousands of different, whatever tasks across that. And so they are paying thousands of dollars, but you wouldn't know that because you don't see the volume. Do you what I'm saying? how would you identify the\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (37:41)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah. There's a lot of ways you could infer. You would never know exactly. But for instance, you scrape a list of every Shopify site and you're going to say, okay, if it's Shopify plus, then that is a high volume Shopify store by default. Therefore, they are much more likely to be using a lot more Zapier tasks. you could, built with will also tell you what their monthly traffic is roughly. It's not perfectly accurate. You're like, okay, I'm just going to assume more monthly traffic equal more Zaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (38:12)\r\nOkay, so this idea would probably be for somebody who has experience in e-commerce, who has experience with creating or at least managing integrations with Zapier. That would maybe want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (38:22)\r\nIt doesn't have to be e-commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (38:25)\r\nWell, just somebody who would have the knowledge to say like, you're a Shopify premium. Like I wouldn't know that. I wouldn't know that just off the bat, right? But somebody who's in that space or who understands e-commerce is going to look at that and say, in order to have that, that's a $5,000 a month subscription. So that's going to justify the spend because they have whatever the volume. But I'm trying to get out like who would be the perfect profile to do business like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (38:50)\r\nsomeone that does not necessarily know how to code, but knows how to use Zapier. Like who is technically savvy enough to know their way around tools like these. Yeah, or like me, right? Like I'm, think like most people our age, I would think. Cause like if you can code.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (39:00)\r\nLike Jordan? We had no... We're like...\r\n\r\n\r\nnot me. I spent 20 minutes today trying to get our VA access to my Facebook business profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (39:16)\r\nWell, in your defense, it's a little tricky in there gets a little hairy and met a business manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (39:20)\r\nIs this thing on? Is this? Are you my grandson?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (39:24)\r\nNo, but like I think if you know how to code, then it might not be the highest and best use of your skills or time. It would definitely be easy enough for you, but yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (39:36)\r\nBut the-\r\n\r\n\r\nDid I lose you? Are you there?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (39:41)\r\nYou broke up, are you there?\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, you were frozen for a second. Yeah, you were frozen for a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (39:45)\r\nnot right. But the added piece to it, because you're saying like, this is the foot in the door, the implementation, you probably would need some level of experience creating these apps. Because it would be hard to go into a business cold and just be like, yeah, you should do a zap for this and a zap for that and zap for this. Like, you don't know how their process flows work. You don't know where and what they should be implementing for their payment processor. You don't know where and what they should be implementing for their\r\n\r\n\r\nyou know, CRM or for their email software or for checkout systems or you know what I mean? Like you probably want to have some expertise in that space, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (40:19)\r\nHmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr you could use AI, right? This, I'm a consultant for X, Y, or Z business. These are the tools they're currently using. I'm now a Zapier expert or a make expert. What would you suggest? I think the hardest part about this business now that I think about it would be learning make. Cause Zapier is very, very easy to learn. But make is a little more difficult. It's doable. There are YouTube channels dedicated to it, but it would take a little time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (40:53)\r\nTo me, doesn't scare me off. If you can get the demand, if you can get the customers, then you can figure out the fulfillment either by going to something. You could teach yourself, you could go through AI and teach yourself, or you could go to Upwork or Fiverr or anybody who has experience with the make integrations and just start outsourcing it. Essentially, you'd have to build out a little agency that you're then managing people, but you're going to do that anyways if you had any ambition to scale the business.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (41:21)\r\nYeah. Can I pivot for a minute? Just kind of a quick tidbit. So you know how we're all like, you know, blue collar businesses where it's at because AI is not about to take the plumber's job, right? It's a meme. It's a thing. So yesterday I replaced the light bulbs in my boy's room and this is normal light bulbs. And later that day the breaker was flipped in their room and I'm like, what? And, Jesse's like, it's because of the light bulbs. And I'm like, okay, being a man, I know that\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (41:43)\r\nBreaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (41:50)\r\nyou're not going to trip a breaker from some little light bulbs in like a fan, right? And she's like, I don't know, it's too coincidental. I'm like, no, you're right. But like that, why would that trip a breaker? Yada, yada, yada. I was about to call an electrician because I couldn't figure it out. Then I just take a picture of the old light bulb. I take a picture of the new light bulb, and I upload them in chat GPT. And I just tell it what's going on. And I'm like, what is going on? And it gave me the most specific answer. It's like certain LED bulbs have this fault that caused them to spike in usage.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere they're like, yes, correct. Chris, you're correct. It should not trip the breaker, but it could be a faulty bulb that's sending the wrong signal to the breaker. So all you gotta do is just return the bulb and buy new ones. Like that just saved me 250 bucks. Like I don't think AI is about to replace the plumber, but I think it's gonna make some good headway. What do we think?\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (42:39)\r\nI don't think it's going to replace the plumber, I do think it's going to make everybody more efficient. Like that's if you look at the trend of technology over time, it has made productivity skyrocket, skyrocket because now instead of sending a letter and waiting for somebody's response, I can send an electronic letter and get their response in, you know, a hundredth of the time. And so there are these like incremental time savings.\r\n\r\n\r\nthat you all of sudden get back that you're then able to reallocate. What I would argue is that in that instance, now the electrician is able to get to the highest and best use of their time. Now it makes electricians even more important because they're only gonna be called out for the jobs that like you can't troubleshoot with AI. And in fact, it makes me a little bit more optimistic about the trade shortage that we have right now. It's something ridiculous. Like for every five tradesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nand tradesmen, I'm lumping in HVAC repair, electrician, auto body, et cetera. For every five that are retiring, two are taking their place. So like we do not have the replacement rate necessary to meet the demand for all of the trades needs moving forward. However, if AI could come in and all of a sudden reduce like just by doing what you did, it reduces demand by 20%. Now, all of a sudden we don't need five. We need three and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so there's a one and a half gap. so like, how do we, how do we now fill the one and a half gap? So I, that's how I view it is like, it's just going to make us more productive because it's never going to fix the, the like, how do I rewire my house? There was an electrical fire. How do I rewire this? Like, I don't want to, I don't want to have to guess and say, I'm pretty sure chat GPT told me what to do. And then have an electrical fire and your house burns down. Like you're still going to want to call an electrician who's actually been certified in that.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (44:21)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah, I think it's not going to take any jobs or anything in the way that I'm talking about, but it's certainly going to make us more efficient. And I think maybe one big takeaway is you've just got to start rewiring your brain to think, I need to ask ChatGPT, just like we had to do with Google. I got to ask Google before I do that. I don't use Google at all anymore. I ask ChatGPT everything. We're best friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (44:49)\r\nMm-hmm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you messed with either Meta's glasses or Apple's Vision Pro? I could see that being something where it's like, all right, I put on the Vision Pro and it's like, hey, I'm looking at this, my breaker is off again, or there's an issue with my car, and it just all of sudden using AI in real time is like, okay, take this off. Like it could troubleshoot for you. So then it either significantly cuts down on the amount of time that you're gonna have.\r\n\r\n\r\nsomeone coming in and diagnosing, or you can solve the problem by not having somebody actually come out and fix it. So I could see it with augmented reality, really, really disrupting things. But the literally coming out and fixing plumbing or repairing your roof or power washing your driveway, AI is not replacing that. Those are still things that are going to have to be done by people. But the diagnostic that you're describing, like\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with it? I think AI definitely will eliminate a lot of need for specialized services for the diagnostics.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (46:00)\r\nAll I know is that thanks to this cheap guy right here, there's some electrician in the Northwest DFW suburbs. It's $250 poorer today because of chat GPT. So I'd say that's enough. That's enough data to make a pretty significant conclusion here, Nick.\r\n\r\n\r\nNik (46:10)\r\nsuck it, Daryl\r\n\r\n\r\nlove it. All right. Hey. Roll Tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris Koerner (46:18)\r\nAlright.",
