    "Frameworks or Mental Models": "- Name: The River Analogy",
    "Core Idea": "Describes the difficulty of transitioning a government contracting business from small business to large, unrestricted contracts, likening it to a deer being pushed into the middle of a river, unable to return to the \"small animal\" side or cross over to the \"predator\" side.",
    "Quote": "\"We call it one side of the river. We call it the river being in the river. One side are all the small little animals who are happy. And on the other side are the huge predators, like waiting to kill somebody. And then all of a sudden you're pushed, you're like this deer that got pushed out in the middle of the river and you can't get back to the smalls. And if you go to the other side, they're just going to rip you to pieces.\"",
    "Steps": "1) Start as a small business in the \"small animal\" side of the river 2) Attempt to grow and cross over to the \"predator\" side 3) Get stuck in the middle, unable to return to the small business side or fully transition to the larger contracts",
    "Challenge": "Concerns about the impact of rising interest rates, inflation, and potential asset value deflation on the broader economy and the government contracting industry",
    "Solution": "Closely monitor economic trends, adjust business strategies and risk management practices accordingly, and be prepared for a prolonged period of \"grinding\" deflation rather than a sudden crisis",

Many small businesses are sitting on valuable customer data/lists that they are not effectively utilizing., 3.
